Main goal of the project is to create EEG device with active alectrodes.

Active electrodes are better than passive ones in a few aspects. Their biggest adventage is that they dont need special skin preparation and so they can be used much faster than 

Project is seperated into smaller parts:
1. Building active electrodes
2. Building EEG device 
3. Building headset for electrodes
4.
